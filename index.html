A long front tongue with a firm high waist wraps the leg and ankle for support and strength. Ice hockey shoes were originally made of high-quality cowhide, and all-plastic molded shoes appeared in the 1960s and 1970s. Now the international use of nylon fiber upper, plastic bottom hockey shoes. These shoes are lighter than leather shoes, hard and moisture-resistant, and are suitable for indoor ice rinks.<br>ball knife<br>Originally a Tito steel blade, now more plastic knife holders are used, high-quality alloy steel blades, which have the advantages of light weight, anti-strike, and not easy to rust. Ice hockey knives are tall and short, with large arcs and thicker blades. The height of the blade prevents the shoes from touching the ice surface when the athlete makes a sharp turn; the blade has a large arc, and the contact area with the ice surface is small, so it can flexibly slide and change direction; the blade is thick and can resist blows without bending; With shallow grooves to make it sharp and durable. The goalkeeper skates are wrapped with special thickened hard leather around the shoes to resist the ball and protect the feet. The goalkeeper skate is quite different from the athlete’s skate. It is all made of metal.<br>protective gear<br>In order to prevent injury in the intense confrontation, athletes wear protective gear all over the body.

        <h1 id="book-of-hockey"><a href="#book-of-hockey" class="headerlink" title="book of hockey"></a>book of hockey</h1><p>The Origins of Ice Hockey was co-authored by three members of the International Society for Hockey Research (SIHR). Originally initiated by full-time computer analyst Martel, and later joined by Swedes Carl Kiden (doctor) and Patrick Gouda (reporter), they uncovered the birthplace of ice hockey through extensive research. the truth.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, their research revealed that the first game may have been traced back to the 1890s.</p>
<p>They found that the name “hockey puck” may have come from the corks they used to serve as pucks. Corks were used as stoppers for beer kegs, and Hock Ale was a popular drink at the time, according to Adam Proteau.</p>
<p>Another shocking discovery is that Charles Darwin was a well-known figure in science and evolution, but no one would associate the famous scientist with ice hockey. However, three SIHR researchers found a link, also including King Edward VII and Prince Albert (Queen Victoria’s princely consort) as two of the earliest participants in the sport.</p>
<p>So how did Darwin get involved with ice hockey?</p>
<p>The researchers discovered something in a letter from Darwin to his son William dated March 1, 1853, in which he wrote: “My dear William…do you have a pond where you can skate? I used to like it very much. Play hockey while skating on the ice.”</p>
<p>Darwin was actually referencing the games he played in Shrewsborough, England, east of the Welsh border in the 1820s. While some might think “Hocky” is a misprint, it’s not. This is exactly what was written in 19th century England. In fact, the reference here is not hockey at all, but a game of ice throwing.</p>
<p>So if the Montreal game in 1875 wasn’t the first ice hockey game, and Darwin’s game in the 1820s wasn’t the first, how far back do we go back to the first game? </p>

        <h1 id="Ice-hockey-diaries"><a href="#Ice-hockey-diaries" class="headerlink" title="Ice hockey diaries"></a>Ice hockey diaries</h1><p>Perhaps I am naturally fond of sports. Whenever I want to hold any novel and exciting activities, I will participate in them. During the Dragon Boat Festival, my friends and I went skating in an underground skating rink next to the north gate of Ditan.</p>
<p>I knew the basement was a cold and humid place. This time I went to the underground skating rink again. It was just “worse”! Sure enough, as soon as I came downstairs, I shivered.</p>
<p>We changed our skates noisily. The skates were so uncomfortable that I had to force my feet in. Although it hurts, all my thoughts are caught by one thing. This is my first skating! I tied my shoelaces in a mess and ran into the “ice cellar” like skating rink.</p>
<p>There was no one in the ice cellar. I began to skate. Although I have long heard that there is no problem for people who can skate like me, it’s better to be careful just in case. I was like a chicken just learning to walk, trembling and taking steps. My heart was full of curiosity and fear - but I didn’t fall! This is really a good start! I was bolder. I skated carefully and tried to remember how I bent and skated when I skated on roller skating move, shake hands… I try to make as standard and correct actions as possible. The ice seemed attractive and kept me from falling.</p>
<p>I smiled, let go of my courage and flew forward happily. The “rustle” sound of my skates rubbing against the ice seems to cheer for my success! I slide lightly on the smooth ice and rotate my wrists and ankles heartily. I seem to be a white swan swimming gracefully on the Swan Lake. At this time, the hazy fog was cut open by the ice skate under my feet, and I opened a way for myself. My vision is clear. In front of me, it is a transparent white.While enjoying the fruits of success, I don’t forget to compete with my peers. I started a “track and field race” with another “skater”. I skated desperately, and the palms of my hands were sweating. The white fog was trampled under our feet. I bent over and naturally shook my arms, put one hand behind my back, and my feet were in eight characters to reduce the friction with the ice. But he slipped so fast that I couldn’t catch up. Suddenly, he “ouch” fell, “boys are fierce!” I thought to myself and continued to slide forward, surpassing him. But he caught up again. It’s hard to get rid of this man! I had no choice but to bend down and continue to rush forward. Gradually, I surpassed him and won the game! I’m so happy. Unexpectedly, I stumbled when I was happy. Alas, it seems that once I succeed, I will get into trouble again! Be careful!</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. I took off my skates and stepped on the ground. Suddenly I felt a sense of satisfaction. My first time, it’s over. Actually, everyone of us got that feeling, and that’s what made us fall in love with skating</p>

<p>After buying the tickets, we went in to change our shoes. Change your shoes and enter the venue. At first, I couldn’t slide at all. I looked left and right to see how they slipped. I saw some people divide their legs into ‘eight’ shapes, spread their hands to the side and slide forward easily. Some put their hands behind their backs, while others are beginners like me. I thought to myself: what’s the difficulty? It’s just sliding around! It’s a piece of cake for me. I learn from others and slide like a mold. But I didn’t expect that as soon as I slipped, I fell and a dog bit the mud. Ah! Unfortunately, thanks to the protective sleeve, it doesn’t hurt much. It turns out that skating is not as simple as I thought. I didn’t lose heart at all and got up again. Because I believe: painstaking people live up to heaven, where there is a will, there is a way. Finally, I learned to skate when I fell and got up again and again. At that time, don’t mention how happy and excited I was! I can finally fly like a bird in the open spaceBy the shuttle, it feels great, not to mention. My friend’s brother is skating, too,I don’t know how many times faster than me. I dragged his clothes and he slipped. As soon as I let go, I fell again.After skating for two hours, we went out. After changing shoes, walking is very painful. But I feel very happy and worth it.</p>

On top of his exceptional talent, he was a tough but clean player, a modest man of great integrity, a leader and something of a matinee idol.That man was Andy Bathgate.</p>

And off the ice, he was the last word in pure vessels, a teetotaler, a non-smoker, a Baptist steeped in moral propriety, the model team captain.”</p>

<li>the first is the station. Instead of facing the goal, face the puck sideways toward the goal, with legs shoulder-width apart for balance and knees slightly bent.</li>
<li>Move the ball some distance in the opposite direction of the shot, taking the most comfortable distance for each person as the standard.</li>
<li>After moving, the nose and toe should be on the same vertical plane, that is, the nose tip corresponds to the toe. Center of gravity on the foot far from the goal, should not be too much to the direction of the puck movement, so easy to lose balance.</li>
<li>Move the puck toward the goal. Again, the tip of the nose is in the same vertical plane as the tip of the foot in front.</li>
<li>while moving the puck, turn your foot in front of the goal, and rotate your body to open up so that your whole body is facing the goal. The club sends the ball forward as well as the body forward, noting that both the hand and club are in front of the body.</li>
<li>At the moment of hitting, the puck is hit out with the help of the whole arm and the power of the waist and abdomen.</li>
<li>Break down the action. We put 4steps together and a shot is done. Pay attention to the Angle of the shot. Shoot high or low as needed.</li>

The crazy sport is a combination of skill, balance and physical strength. It’s a high-speed, crash-filled event and one of the most entertaining events at the Winter Olympics. The National Stadium will host all of the men’s ice hockey events at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, some of the women’s ice hockey finals and some of the ice skating events of the Winter Paralympics. At the same time, Canada, the traditional power of the hockey world and the team that has won more gold MEDALS than any other in the sport, will once again defend its supremacy. Ice hockey made its Olympic debut in 1920 at the Antwerp Summer Games. The winbourne Falcons of Manitoba won the gold medal for Canada. Ice hockey was added to the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France, in 1924. It was the beginning of Canada’s reign in ice hockey. The country that originated the sport, Canada had won the previous three Winter Olympics and five of the previous six. In particular, at the 1924 Games in Chamonix, Canada produced a series of phenomenal results, beating Czechoslovakia 30-0, Sweden 22-0, and Switzerland 33-0. The results were jaw-dropping: Canada scored 85 goals while its opponents failed to score any. In the final leg, Canada saw off Great Britain (19-2) and the United States (6-1) to claim the title, thus securing a memorable Winter Olympics title. One of them, Harold Ellis Harry Watson, captivated the public with his consistent performances and set a record that will probably never be broken. Watson, nicknamed ‘Moose’, was a flying ace in the Royal Flying Corps during world War I. The 26-year-old has made an indelible mark on winter sports because he seems to be able to score at will. In this match against Czechoslovakia, he scored an astonishing 11 goals. And that wasn’t all. In his later showdown with the Swiss, the skilful Ontario native set an Olympic record of 13 goals in one game. Watson’s scoring prowess is not limited to underdogs. He scored half of Canada’s goals in a 6-1 rout of rival U.S. team USA in the final, bringing his total to 36 goals in five games. So much so that canadians say of hockey, “It’s our game.”</p>

        <h1 id="Story-of-Ice-hockey"><a href="#Story-of-Ice-hockey" class="headerlink" title="Story of Ice hockey"></a>Story of Ice hockey</h1><p>Ice hockey originated in Canada in the mid-19th century. A popular ice game in Kingston, Canada, involves players chasing and slapping wooden hockey puck across a frozen lake with skates strapped to their feet and sticks in hand. At that time, the number of participants and the venue were unlimited, only two wooden poles as the goal, which is the predecessor of modern ice hockey. In 1879 McGill University in Montreal, Canada organized an official ice hockey match under the rules of W.F. Professor Robertson and Professor R.F. Smith. Initially 11 participants from each side, then nine, then seven, and finally six. Clubs and balls have also been improved. Later, the game gradually spread to the United States and Europe. The International Ice Hockey Federation was founded in 1908 in Paris and is headquartered in Vienna, Austria. Ice hockey was included in the seventh Olympic Games in 1920. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics were held in France, and The Canadian team won the gold medal by a landslide. From 1924 to 1953, Canada often took the lead in the world ice hockey, winning the world championship many times. In 1954, the Soviet Union defeated Canada to win the 21st World Hockey Championship, breaking Canada’s dominance in ice hockey. Ice hockey has a history of more than 60 years in China. In 1935, the first ice hockey match was held at the first North China Ice Games In Peiping. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, ice hockey developed rapidly. In 1953, the first National Ice Games were held in Harbin. Five teams participated in the ice hockey competition. Later in the northeast, north China and other provinces, cities have established various forms of ice hockey teams. National ice hockey games have been held annually since 1955. After 1956, The Chinese ice hockey team began to participate in international competitions. In 1981, Beijing hosted the World Ice Hockey Group C championship, and The Chinese team won the second place and was promoted to Group B. The Chinese team won the gold medal in the first Asian Winter Games held in Japan in 1986.</p>
<p>Ice hockey is a sport that combines the techniques and tactical ideas of football, hockey and speed skating. It was invented a little later than football, hockey and speed skating.</p>
<p>Ice hockey requires agile and skillful curling skills, fast and changeable skating skills and collective cooperation consciousness. It is a team sport with strong physical antagonism.</p>
<p>It is recorded that before the British and French settlers and British colonialists came to Canada, the native Indians were already playing an interesting game on the ice. Later, after the British colonizers occupied North America, the British soldiers in Canada were inspired by the Indians. In their spare time, they often hit cans on ice.</p>
<p>When the ice activities of various countries are still in the game stage, The Canadian student Wu Robertson used the hockey method learned during the study in The UK on the ice, and combined with the characteristics of the Indian “La Crosse” ball, created a new type of ice sport, which is the embryonic form of ice hockey.</p>
<p>In 1858, the movement spread rapidly from Montreal and Quebec to the whole of Canada. Therefore, the original game of ice hockey is also called “Canadian ball”. In 1875, simple rules for ice hockey were established. 1879 Ice hockey began. 1890 The first ice hockey organization, the Hockey Association of Ontario, was formed.</p>
<p>Since then, the sport spread to Europe and countries around the world and popular.</p>
