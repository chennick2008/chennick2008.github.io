        <p> Story: my favourite NHL team</p>
<p>One of my favorite hockey memories is going to the NHL for the first time to watch the Stanley Cup Finals. It was the first time I went to an NHL game when Babcock led the Detroit Red Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals. It was a great experience for him. In the 2010 Ice hockey finals, Crosby was a bit of an underwhelmer for Canada against the United States. But a into overtime, Crosby state instantly completed the very big change from the start of the normal players suddenly becomes a star of the deposit to, in one fell swoop into a winning goal, making Canada 3-2 win directly, I was attracted by the technology and play a ball game playing style Crosby, more because of his attention to the Pittsburgh penguins, penguins fans.</p>

Due to the wonderful performance of the players he personally appreciated, Liu Yapeng himself commentated passionately. Later, he was praised by the penguins’ fans for being objective and neutral. He was happy, but his heart was beating, because penguins fans praised him for being objective and neutral, which probably meant that the commentary wasn’t. So he immediately went back and listened to the commentary twice, reviewing what might have rattled a fan’s nerves and taking notes to determine what not to say. At the end of last year, Liu Yapeng encountered a problem in the course of interpretation guru Yu Jia – what on earth are we explaining for the audience. Liu yapeng’s own answer is that we are explaining for the audience’s emotions, but also not only for the audience’s emotions. If only to explain the audience’s emotions, the commentator may fall into the situation of emotional outburst by hook or by hook, but deviate from objectivity and fairness. And this is liu Yapeng in the process of commentary hockey commentary this job a little bit of thinking.</p>

The cold field, “full of heat” – cold is ice, hot is the hearts of hockey teenagers.</p>
<p>The training base of Guangzhou’s local ice hockey club, Yangcheng Lightning Ice Sports Club, is here. Every training day, the arena echoes with a special symphony: there are shouts from young players, loud reminders from coaches, and cheering voices from parents of “ice parents” to their children.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the field, Yu Xianghe is the teaching director of the team. This man from northeast China is a national athlete and a former member of the national ice hockey team. He has a lot of experience. The Yangcheng Lightning club was established in 2007 and now has five tiers: U6, U8, U10, U12 and U14. The students mainly come from Tianhe, Huadu and Baiyun districts, as well as from Foshan and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>On the other side of the field was a blond young coach from Ufa, Russia, named Roman Muratov, a former KHL player. “I’ve been here for two years.” “I’m happy here,” Roman said. It’s not easy for the kids, day in and day out, we’re getting better every day. I am very happy for my players, after every training, after every game, they grow.”</p>
<p>After two years in China, Roman can already understand some Chinese, and he often shouts “Quicken quicken! “Defend! “Race! Such words.</p>
<p>Roman and Yu Xianghe are a pair of complementary partners. Roman’s teaching method is more lively, and he often comes up with ideas to design small games to entertain children. Yu Xianghe’s training focuses on the overall situation, more details, more traditional Chinese coach style, and parents more smooth communication.</p>
<p>Yu Xianghe was happy to work with his Russian partner: “My English is not very good, but our little players are very good at English and sometimes translate for us. Sometimes we use mobile translators to communicate, which has caused quite a few jokes.”</p>
<p>“Ice hockey is something I grew up playing, and in my mind, whether it’s a Russian kid or a Chinese kid, there’s no difference.” Roman said: “If you love it, work hard and keep training, you can be a great player in the future.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be the Beijing Winter Olympics.” Roman is</p>

It has no publication date, but reading it reveals it’s from 1952. Although entitled “Detroit’s Big Three,” it’s not about the local automakers General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, but the trio of Red Wings pictured on its cover who made up one of the top lines in NHL history.</p>
<p>Author Ed Fitkin wrote of Sid Abel, the line’s center and the eldest of the three, “Abel will go down in Detroit’s club history as the greatest competitor and inspirational force the Red Wings ever had.”<br>Abel’s youthful wings Ted Lindsay and Gordie Howe – also terrific competitors and inspirations – would always agree. They eventually went on without him, each to an extraordinary career, but the veteran Abel helped mold them into Hockey Hall of Famers. He’d settle down the fiery Lindsay and motivate the laid-back Howe, while directing their movements and setting their tactics on the ice. </p>
<p>“I don’t know where I’d be without him,” said a young Howe. “He just has to whack me with his stick when I’m not playing well and say, ‘Get going,’ and that’s all I ever need.” </p>
<p>“Abel is the greatest of them all,” Lindsay said. “He seems to know more about what I’m going to do than I do myself and he’s always in the right spot.”</p>

In this game, my opponent was very strong. It was the very famous Chaoyang district team. We are Dongcheng District, and we are also very strong. We are very prepared for this. Sufficient. For example, all the members of our team arrived at the ice rink early for ground training. I was no exception, but an accident happened. The foot of one of the sending and receiving guards of our team got crooked during ground training. We The team had to replace his position with a substitute player, which made our level drop a lot.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the game officially started. Our team’s center took the lead to snatch the ball from the opponent’s hand and passed it to me. He made a gesture to make me want money to speed up the ball. I knew it at first glance. We came over, and the two of us played an almost perfect match in the next five seconds. We missed a defender on the opposite side. Between our teams center forward, a blue line shot vigorously, and the ball flew directly out, but despite the fact that it was In this way, but still can’t bear that the goalkeeper on the opposite side is the country’s top presence, and it is difficult for us to score goals. In this way, our two teams made it to the last few minutes of the third game. At this time, the opposing player took advantage of our substitution and rushed in with the ball, passing all of our players, leaving no one left. Then with a bang, he scored the first goal of the entire game with a catapult. As the goal was scored, the whistle rang at the end of the game. We lost, but we have tried our best. </p>

<p>That’s saying a lot, because the buildup for the young center, who turned 19 during the season, was considerable. It was more impressive because his was a shortened rookie season; he missed 37 games because of a fractured clavicle but scored 48 points (16 goals, 32 assists) in 45 games.</p>

He’s a generational talent regarded for much of the 2010s as the best player in the world. Just like Wayne Gretzky said in 2016, Crosby “has proven over and over that he’s the best player in the game today. And it seems like the more important the game, the more impact that he makes on a game.”</p>
<p>The native of Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, played one season at Shattuck-St. Mary’s, a prestigious prep school in Minnesota, and two seasons with Rimouski of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. He led the QMJHL in scoring each time and helped Rimouski reach the Memorial Cup Final in 2005.</p>

        <p>滑冰经验<br>热身运动别忘做。准备活动能提高中枢神经系统的兴奋性，升高肌肉的温度，畅通血液循环，增加关节<br>及韧带的柔韧性和活动范围，做了准备活动后再溜冰，<br>一般不易摔倒。<br>溜冰前应注意休息。因为溜冰时下肢和踝关节最吃力，身体过度疲劳溜滑时便很难保持平衡，容易摔<br>倒。另外滑冰时最好每隔15—30分钟休息一次，休息时<br>应把鞋带解开，使脚上血液循环通畅，更好地消除脚部疲劳。<br>以上使一些关于最基础的滑冰小妙招，下面我会介绍一些滑冰的技巧。<br>1。急停:双脚同时bai转90度，身体向后，双脚完成90度旋转的同时，一只脚内刃另一只脚外刃同时压<br>地面。身体的姿势是：完成转体的同时，身体向后倾<br>斜10度左右并下蹲成半蹲式。在身体下蹲的同时加力压地面。双手置于身体两侧舞动保持平衡。这种方<br>法可以马上停下来，在职业比赛中也十分实用。<br>2。急转:向左急转弯，首先要把重心移到左腿上。身体前倾、膝关节屈曲，左脚稍前、右脚稍后。身体<br>成半蹲式，左脚外刃、右脚内刃用力向转弯的反方向压<br>地。身体向左倾斜，两脚平行的向左边划两条“弧线”，转弯即可完成。</p>
<p>滑冰技巧<br>陆地准备活动<br>低年龄段(6-8岁)<br>在滑冰或者打冰球之前应该先做真被活动, 这些准备活动可以十分有效的帮助大家更好的为滑冰做<br>好准备, 这样的话你就更不容易受伤了, 这样就降低了滑冰对你的伤害的风险,下面让我来给大家说一<br>下伤病之前最好做什么准备活动吧:</p>
<ol>
<li>高抬腿, 用途: 做这项运动可以有效的拉伸韧带的, 训练中高抬腿是让大腿, 小腿, 脚腕增加力<br>量的</li>
<li>小碎步, 用途: 放松腿部肌肉的动作, 同时也可以让你的冰球训练更加有效</li>
<li>交叉步, 做法: 动作开始前，两臂侧平举，为的是动作开始后保持身体平衡，以右腿先动为例，<br>动作开始后，右腿向左侧做交叉步，右脚落点在左脚的左前方，此时髋关节随右腿运行轨迹转动。用途<br>可以让你的身体出汗,可以在打冰球的时候减少受伤, 同时也练习了自己压步.</li>
<li>开合跳, 作用: 开合跳可以练习手和脚的协调能力.</li>
<li>蹲起, 用途: 蹲起可以练习大腿肌肉,让大腿更有力, 滑冰的时候可以滑的更有力,更快, 同时也<br>可以放松肌肉.<br>陆地训练:<br>大家一定要把陆地训练和准备活动分开,准备活动是在陆地训练和冰上训练之间进行的, 它们不一样,陆<br>陆地训练主要是给打冰球的人准备的, 一些专业或者职业的队员中,他们不止是在冰上训练,他们还需要<br>配备陆地训练, 一般情况下是两个小时的冰上训练再加上一个小时的陆地训练这一个小时的陆地训练十<br>分重要, 在陆地上, 训练的效率可不比冰上查, 让我们一起来了解一下把:<br>一、: 体力训练<br>体力训练非常好理解,一般都是一些慢跑, 长跑, 折返跑 等等, 这些体力训练一方面是练习耐力,一方<br>面是练习了爆发力, 这种体力训练虽然很累, 但是效果很不错. 体力训练通常情况下都是在训练的开始<br>或者结尾来练习的.下面让我来说一下体力训练都有什么方法</li>
<li>折返跑, 折返跑大家应该很熟悉了, 就是规定两个点, 这两个点的距离一般都在三十米, 一次大概<br>跑4-6个来回, 这样可以有效的练习在冰场上的爆发力.</li>
<li>长跑, 长跑是非常常见的活动,如果是为了滑冰的话一般都是2-4公里的长跑, 这样可以练习在冰上<br>连续打球的耐力.</li>
<li>30米跑, 三十米跑可以练习队员的爆发力, 提速时的速度, 在冰场上都是很有用的.</li>
<li>五点跑， 五点跑就是在按二一二的样子摆出五个点，在进行五个点的折返跑，银版情况下都是从中<br>间的位置跑到左上角然后摸地，立刻返回在向右上角，左下角和右下角一次重复，这主意在做这个运动<br>的时候一定要注意自己是否摸地。<br>二、 ：技术训练<br>技术训练是陆地训练的一大要素，技术训练可以很有效的解决冰时的问题，可以在陆地上练习控球，拨<br>球，练习一些拉杆类的细致的技术，这些技术正是冰球所不可缺少的，这种技术正好可以通过在陆地上<br>训练来提升，但是我们该怎么确定我们在陆地上到底应该练什么才能在冰上起到效果呢？让我来告诉你<br>吧！</li>
<li>拉射，拉射是一种最为常见也是最为简单的一种射门方法了，这种射门的方法应该是每一个学冰球<br>的人的第一种射门的方法了，在陆地上，</li>

        <h1 id="Aleksandr-Ovechkin"><a href="#Aleksandr-Ovechkin" class="headerlink" title="Aleksandr Ovechkin"></a>Aleksandr Ovechkin</h1><p>Ovechkin is already the greatest goal-scorer of the 21st century, with a chance to become No. 1 in NHL history.</p>
<p>The Moscow native became the eighth member of the NHL’s 700-goal club when he scored for the Washington Capitals against the New Jersey Devils on Feb. 22, 2020; at 34 years and 158 days, he joined all-time leader Wayne Gretzky (29 years, 342 days) as the only players to reach 700 goals before turning 35. He kept on scoring after reaching No. 700. Ovechkin won the Maurice Richard Trophy for the ninth time in 2019-20 after sharing the NHL lead in goals with David Pastrnak of the Boston Bruins – each scored 48.</p>
