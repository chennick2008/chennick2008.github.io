        <p>One of my favorite hockey memories is going to the NHL for the first time to watch the Stanley Cup Finals. It was the first time I went to an NHL game when Babcock led the Detroit Red Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals. It was a great experience for him. In the 2010 Ice hockey finals, Crosby was a bit of an underwhelmer for Canada against the United States. But a into overtime, Crosby state instantly completed the very big change from the start of the normal players suddenly becomes a star of the deposit to, in one fell swoop into a winning goal, making Canada 3-2 win directly, I was attracted by the technology and play a ball game playing style Crosby, more because of his attention to the Pittsburgh penguins, penguins fans.</p>

        <p>Once Liu Yapeng commentated on a game about the penguins. Due to the wonderful performance of the players he personally appreciated, Liu Yapeng himself commentated passionately. Later, he was praised by the penguins’ fans for being objective and neutral. He was happy, but his heart was beating, because penguins fans praised him for being objective and neutral, which probably meant that the commentary wasn’t. So he immediately went back and listened to the commentary twice, reviewing what might have rattled a fan’s nerves and taking notes to determine what not to say. At the end of last year, Liu Yapeng encountered a problem in the course of interpretation guru Yu Jia – what on earth are we explaining for the audience. Liu yapeng’s own answer is that we are explaining for the audience’s emotions, but also not only for the audience’s emotions. If only to explain the audience’s emotions, the commentator may fall into the situation of emotional outburst by hook or by hook, but deviate from objectivity and fairness. And this is liu Yapeng in the process of commentary hockey commentary this job a little bit of thinking.</p>

        <p>Every Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, guangzhou Youtopia Vitality Base Vitality Ice rink is especially busy - because these days it is hockey training day. The cold field, “full of heat” – cold is ice, hot is the hearts of hockey teenagers.</p>
<p>The training base of Guangzhou’s local ice hockey club, Yangcheng Lightning Ice Sports Club, is here. Every training day, the arena echoes with a special symphony: there are shouts from young players, loud reminders from coaches, and cheering voices from parents of “ice parents” to their children.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the field, Yu Xianghe is the teaching director of the team. This man from northeast China is a national athlete and a former member of the national ice hockey team. He has a lot of experience. The Yangcheng Lightning club was established in 2007 and now has five tiers: U6, U8, U10, U12 and U14. The students mainly come from Tianhe, Huadu and Baiyun districts, as well as from Foshan and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>On the other side of the field was a blond young coach from Ufa, Russia, named Roman Muratov, a former KHL player. “I’ve been here for two years.” “I’m happy here,” Roman said. It’s not easy for the kids, day in and day out, we’re getting better every day. I am very happy for my players, after every training, after every game, they grow.”</p>
<p>After two years in China, Roman can already understand some Chinese, and he often shouts “Quicken quicken! “Defend! “Race! Such words.</p>
<p>Roman and Yu Xianghe are a pair of complementary partners. Roman’s teaching method is more lively, and he often comes up with ideas to design small games to entertain children. Yu Xianghe’s training focuses on the overall situation, more details, more traditional Chinese coach style, and parents more smooth communication.</p>
<p>Yu Xianghe was happy to work with his Russian partner: “My English is not very good, but our little players are very good at English and sometimes translate for us. Sometimes we use mobile translators to communicate, which has caused quite a few jokes.”</p>
<p>“Ice hockey is something I grew up playing, and in my mind, whether it’s a Russian kid or a Chinese kid, there’s no difference.” Roman said: “If you love it, work hard and keep training, you can be a great player in the future.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be the Beijing Winter Olympics.” Roman is</p>

        <p>The paperback book is old, its pulpy pages now a yellow-brownish color and its pasty binding worn. It has no publication date, but reading it reveals it’s from 1952. Although entitled “Detroit’s Big Three,” it’s not about the local automakers General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, but the trio of Red Wings pictured on its cover who made up one of the top lines in NHL history.</p>
<p>Author Ed Fitkin wrote of Sid Abel, the line’s center and the eldest of the three, “Abel will go down in Detroit’s club history as the greatest competitor and inspirational force the Red Wings ever had.”<br>Abel’s youthful wings Ted Lindsay and Gordie Howe – also terrific competitors and inspirations – would always agree. They eventually went on without him, each to an extraordinary career, but the veteran Abel helped mold them into Hockey Hall of Famers. He’d settle down the fiery Lindsay and motivate the laid-back Howe, while directing their movements and setting their tactics on the ice. </p>
<p>“I don’t know where I’d be without him,” said a young Howe. “He just has to whack me with his stick when I’m not playing well and say, ‘Get going,’ and that’s all I ever need.” </p>
<p>“Abel is the greatest of them all,” Lindsay said. “He seems to know more about what I’m going to do than I do myself and he’s always in the right spot.”</p>

        <p>This Friday, I participated in a Beijing district team competition. In this game, my opponent was very strong. It was the very famous Chaoyang district team. We are Dongcheng District, and we are also very strong. We are very prepared for this. Sufficient. For example, all the members of our team arrived at the ice rink early for ground training. I was no exception, but an accident happened. The foot of one of the sending and receiving guards of our team got crooked during ground training. We The team had to replace his position with a substitute player, which made our level drop a lot.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the game officially started. Our team’s center took the lead to snatch the ball from the opponent’s hand and passed it to me. He made a gesture to make me want money to speed up the ball. I knew it at first glance. We came over, and the two of us played an almost perfect match in the next five seconds. We missed a defender on the opposite side. Between our teams center forward, a blue line shot vigorously, and the ball flew directly out, but despite the fact that it was In this way, but still can’t bear that the goalkeeper on the opposite side is the country’s top presence, and it is difficult for us to score goals. In this way, our two teams made it to the last few minutes of the third game. At this time, the opposing player took advantage of our substitution and rushed in with the ball, passing all of our players, leaving no one left. Then with a bang, he scored the first goal of the entire game with a catapult. As the goal was scored, the whistle rang at the end of the game. We lost, but we have tried our best. </p>

<p>That’s saying a lot, because the buildup for the young center, who turned 19 during the season, was considerable. It was more impressive because his was a shortened rookie season; he missed 37 games because of a fractured clavicle but scored 48 points (16 goals, 32 assists) in 45 games.</p>

He’s a generational talent regarded for much of the 2010s as the best player in the world. Just like Wayne Gretzky said in 2016, Crosby “has proven over and over that he’s the best player in the game today. And it seems like the more important the game, the more impact that he makes on a game.”</p>
<p>The native of Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, played one season at Shattuck-St. Mary’s, a prestigious prep school in Minnesota, and two seasons with Rimouski of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
