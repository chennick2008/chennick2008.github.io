        <h1 id="Story-of-Ice-hockey"><a href="#Story-of-Ice-hockey" class="headerlink" title="Story of Ice hockey"></a>Story of Ice hockey</h1><p>Ice hockey originated in Canada in the mid-19th century. A popular ice game in Kingston, Canada, involves players chasing and slapping wooden hockey puck across a frozen lake with skates strapped to their feet and sticks in hand. At that time, the number of participants and the venue were unlimited, only two wooden poles as the goal, which is the predecessor of modern ice hockey. In 1879 McGill University in Montreal, Canada organized an official ice hockey match under the rules of W.F. Professor Robertson and Professor R.F. Smith. Initially 11 participants from each side, then nine, then seven, and finally six. Clubs and balls have also been improved. Later, the game gradually spread to the United States and Europe. The International Ice Hockey Federation was founded in 1908 in Paris and is headquartered in Vienna, Austria. Ice hockey was included in the seventh Olympic Games in 1920. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics were held in France, and The Canadian team won the gold medal by a landslide. From 1924 to 1953, Canada often took the lead in the world ice hockey, winning the world championship many times. In 1954, the Soviet Union defeated Canada to win the 21st World Hockey Championship, breaking Canada’s dominance in ice hockey. Ice hockey has a history of more than 60 years in China. In 1935, the first ice hockey match was held at the first North China Ice Games In Peiping. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, ice hockey developed rapidly. In 1953, the first National Ice Games were held in Harbin. Five teams participated in the ice hockey competition. Later in the northeast, north China and other provinces, cities have established various forms of ice hockey teams. National ice hockey games have been held annually since 1955. After 1956, The Chinese ice hockey team began to participate in international competitions. In 1981, Beijing hosted the World Ice Hockey Group C championship, and The Chinese team won the second place and was promoted to Group B. The Chinese team won the gold medal in the first Asian Winter Games held in Japan in 1986.</p>
<p>Ice hockey is a sport that combines the techniques and tactical ideas of football, hockey and speed skating. It was invented a little later than football, hockey and speed skating.</p>
<p>Ice hockey requires agile and skillful curling skills, fast and changeable skating skills and collective cooperation consciousness. It is a team sport with strong physical antagonism.</p>
<p>It is recorded that before the British and French settlers and British colonialists came to Canada, the native Indians were already playing an interesting game on the ice. Later, after the British colonizers occupied North America, the British soldiers in Canada were inspired by the Indians. In their spare time, they often hit cans on ice.</p>
<p>When the ice activities of various countries are still in the game stage, The Canadian student Wu Robertson used the hockey method learned during the study in The UK on the ice, and combined with the characteristics of the Indian “La Crosse” ball, created a new type of ice sport, which is the embryonic form of ice hockey.</p>
<p>In 1858, the movement spread rapidly from Montreal and Quebec to the whole of Canada. Therefore, the original game of ice hockey is also called “Canadian ball”. In 1875, simple rules for ice hockey were established. 1879 Ice hockey began. 1890 The first ice hockey organization, the Hockey Association of Ontario, was formed.</p>
<p>Since then, the sport spread to Europe and countries around the world and popular.</p>
