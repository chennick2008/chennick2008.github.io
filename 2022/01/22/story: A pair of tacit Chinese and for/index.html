The cold field, “full of heat” – cold is ice, hot is the hearts of hockey teenagers.</p>
<p>The training base of Guangzhou’s local ice hockey club, Yangcheng Lightning Ice Sports Club, is here. Every training day, the arena echoes with a special symphony: there are shouts from young players, loud reminders from coaches, and cheering voices from parents of “ice parents” to their children.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the field, Yu Xianghe is the teaching director of the team. This man from northeast China is a national athlete and a former member of the national ice hockey team. He has a lot of experience. The Yangcheng Lightning club was established in 2007 and now has five tiers: U6, U8, U10, U12 and U14. The students mainly come from Tianhe, Huadu and Baiyun districts, as well as from Foshan and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>On the other side of the field was a blond young coach from Ufa, Russia, named Roman Muratov, a former KHL player. “I’ve been here for two years.” “I’m happy here,” Roman said. It’s not easy for the kids, day in and day out, we’re getting better every day. I am very happy for my players, after every training, after every game, they grow.”</p>
<p>After two years in China, Roman can already understand some Chinese, and he often shouts “Quicken quicken! “Defend! “Race! Such words.</p>
<p>Roman and Yu Xianghe are a pair of complementary partners. Roman’s teaching method is more lively, and he often comes up with ideas to design small games to entertain children. Yu Xianghe’s training focuses on the overall situation, more details, more traditional Chinese coach style, and parents more smooth communication.</p>
<p>Yu Xianghe was happy to work with his Russian partner: “My English is not very good, but our little players are very good at English and sometimes translate for us. Sometimes we use mobile translators to communicate, which has caused quite a few jokes.”</p>
<p>“Ice hockey is something I grew up playing, and in my mind, whether it’s a Russian kid or a Chinese kid, there’s no difference.” Roman said: “If you love it, work hard and keep training, you can be a great player in the future.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be the Beijing Winter Olympics.” Roman is</p>
