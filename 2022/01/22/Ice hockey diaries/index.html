        <p>Perhaps I am naturally fond of sports. Whenever I want to hold any novel and exciting activities, I will participate in them. During the Dragon Boat Festival, my friends and I went skating in an underground skating rink next to the north gate of Ditan.</p>
<p>I knew the basement was a cold and humid place. This time I went to the underground skating rink again. It was just “worse”! Sure enough, as soon as I came downstairs, I shivered.</p>
<p>We changed our skates noisily. The skates were so uncomfortable that I had to force my feet in. Although it hurts, all my thoughts are caught by one thing. This is my first skating! I tied my shoelaces in a mess and ran into the “ice cellar” like skating rink.</p>
<p>There was no one in the ice cellar. I began to skate. Although I have long heard that there is no problem for people who can skate like me, it’s better to be careful just in case. I was like a chicken just learning to walk, trembling and taking steps. My heart was full of curiosity and fear - but I didn’t fall! This is really a good start! I was bolder. I skated carefully and tried to remember how I bent and skated when I skated on roller skating move, shake hands… I try to make as standard and correct actions as possible. The ice seemed attractive and kept me from falling.</p>
<p>I smiled, let go of my courage and flew forward happily. The “rustle” sound of my skates rubbing against the ice seems to cheer for my success! I slide lightly on the smooth ice and rotate my wrists and ankles heartily. I seem to be a white swan swimming gracefully on the Swan Lake. At this time, the hazy fog was cut open by the ice skate under my feet, and I opened a way for myself. My vision is clear. In front of me, it is a transparent white.While enjoying the fruits of success, I don’t forget to compete with my peers. I started a “track and field race” with another “skater”. I skated desperately, and the palms of my hands were sweating. The white fog was trampled under our feet. I bent over and naturally shook my arms, put one hand behind my back, and my feet were in eight characters to reduce the friction with the ice. But he slipped so fast that I couldn’t catch up. Suddenly, he “ouch” fell, “boys are fierce!” I thought to myself and continued to slide forward, surpassing him. But he caught up again. It’s hard to get rid of this man! I had no choice but to bend down and continue to rush forward. Gradually, I surpassed him and won the game! I’m so happy. Unexpectedly, I stumbled when I was happy. Alas, it seems that once I succeed, I will get into trouble again! Be careful!</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. I took off my skates and stepped on the ground. Suddenly I felt a sense of satisfaction. My first time, it’s over. Actually, everyone of us got that feeling, and that’s what made us fall in love with skating</p>
