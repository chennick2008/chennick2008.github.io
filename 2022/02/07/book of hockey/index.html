        <h1 id="book-of-hockey"><a href="#book-of-hockey" class="headerlink" title="book of hockey"></a>book of hockey</h1><p>The Origins of Ice Hockey was co-authored by three members of the International Society for Hockey Research (SIHR). Originally initiated by full-time computer analyst Martel, and later joined by Swedes Carl Kiden (doctor) and Patrick Gouda (reporter), they uncovered the birthplace of ice hockey through extensive research. the truth.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, their research revealed that the first game may have been traced back to the 1890s.</p>
<p>They found that the name “hockey puck” may have come from the corks they used to serve as pucks. Corks were used as stoppers for beer kegs, and Hock Ale was a popular drink at the time, according to Adam Proteau.</p>
<p>Another shocking discovery is that Charles Darwin was a well-known figure in science and evolution, but no one would associate the famous scientist with ice hockey. However, three SIHR researchers found a link, also including King Edward VII and Prince Albert (Queen Victoria’s princely consort) as two of the earliest participants in the sport.</p>
<p>So how did Darwin get involved with ice hockey?</p>
<p>The researchers discovered something in a letter from Darwin to his son William dated March 1, 1853, in which he wrote: “My dear William…do you have a pond where you can skate? I used to like it very much. Play hockey while skating on the ice.”</p>
<p>Darwin was actually referencing the games he played in Shrewsborough, England, east of the Welsh border in the 1820s. While some might think “Hocky” is a misprint, it’s not. This is exactly what was written in 19th century England. In fact, the reference here is not hockey at all, but a game of ice throwing.</p>
<p>So if the Montreal game in 1875 wasn’t the first ice hockey game, and Darwin’s game in the 1820s wasn’t the first, how far back do we go back to the first game? </p>
